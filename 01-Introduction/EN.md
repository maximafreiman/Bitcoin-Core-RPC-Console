RPC Console Introduction
---
Welcome to the first part of the chapter discussing the RPC Console in a Bitcoin node, friends. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Before we dive into the technical discussion, which I hope can be understood and applied by those of you who are already running a node, it would be great to first understand what the RPC Console actually is.

Simply put, the RPC Console in the Bitcoin node GUI is like a “chat room” where you talk directly to your node. There, you can type commands and the node will respond with information or actions, such as checking your balance, viewing transactions, or monitoring the network status, all through a graphical interface without needing to open a terminal.

Now, for those of you who may not know, node software generally comes in two types. The first is the GUI (Graphical User Interface), which is based on a visual display. When you use a GUI, you do not need to deal with coding, because everything is already equipped with features like menus, windows, and other interface elements. The second type is called the CLI. CLI (Command Line Interface) is a way to use a program by typing text-based commands in a terminal or command prompt, without any visual elements like buttons or menus.

Do they work the same way? More or less, yes. The difference is that the GUI is more practical because it is already integrated into the node application itself. The CLI, on the other hand, is separate and usually found in your node’s folder under the name “bitcoin-cli.” Because the GUI is more practical, we will use the GUI for all future discussions about the RPC Console.

So, how do you open it? First, of course, you need to open your node client software. Whether it is Core or Knots, it is up to you. I will use Knots as an example here, but the process is more or less the same.

This is more or less the first page, friends. The node has not fully finished syncing yet because the laptop I am using was turned off for more than half a day. But that’s okay, even without full sync, we can still access it.

First, click “Window” in the top-left corner.

After that, select “Console.” Click the text that I have circled.

Now, this is what the RPC Console interface on our node looks like.

If you look at the top-right corner, there are three buttons: “A+” to increase the text size, “A-” to decrease it, and “x” (close) to restart the RPC Console.

And at the very bottom, this is the “command line bar,” friends. This is where we will type the command prompts or instructions for the node to verify any information we want.

That wraps up the introduction to the RPC Console on a Bitcoin node. Now, for those of you who are already running a node, try repeating the steps and practice on your own. From time to time, do it without looking at the guide so you can remember it better.

Thank you, and see you again in the next chapter.
