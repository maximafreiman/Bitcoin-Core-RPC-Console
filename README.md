# Bitcoin Core RPC Console

This repository documents the RPC commands available in the Bitcoin Core GUI console, with short explanations and usage examples. It is also compatible with Bitcoin Knots, as Knots is a fork of Bitcoin Core and supports the same RPC interface.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to help users understand how to interact directly with their own Bitcoin node using the built-in GUI RPC Console, without unnecessary jargon. It serves as a practical learning resource for exploring how Bitcoin Core and Knots expose protocol-level functionality through a simple, visual command interface.

## Who This Is For
- Bitcoin users running their own node through a graphical interface
- Learners who want hands-on examples of how Bitcoin works from the node level
- Educators creating workshops or learning material based on GUI interaction

## What You’ll Find
- Curated lists of commonly used RPC commands
- Short, clear explanations of what each command does
- Practical examples you can run directly in the GUI console
- Notes on how commands relate to wallet, blockchain, and network behavior

## Compatibility
This documentation works with
- Bitcoin Core GUI RPC Console
- Bitcoin Knots GUI

## How to Use
1. Run a Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots node with the graphical interface.
2. Open the RPC Console in the GUI by navigating to Window then Console.
3. Browse this repository to find a command you want to learn.
4. Read the explanation and example, then try it in your own console.

> Always use a test environment or a wallet with small amounts when experimenting with transaction related commands.

## Structure
```
/commands
  ├─ blockchain.md
  ├─ wallet.md
  ├─ network.md
  └─ mining.md
```

Each file groups RPC commands by category and explains them in a simple, step by step way.
